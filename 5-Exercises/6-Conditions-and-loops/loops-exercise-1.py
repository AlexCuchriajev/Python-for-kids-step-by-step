## Loops. Exercise #1
# We have a list of colors
colors = ["red", "green", "yellow", "purple", "orange", "violet", "black"]
# Write code that loops over the list and adds all the strings
# together to form one large combined string
# (don't add any spaces between them)
# The combined string should be in all UPPERCASE as well
# Save the result in a variable called result

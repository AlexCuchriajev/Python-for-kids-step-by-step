## Conditions. Exercise #3
import random
choice = random.choice(['apple','salad', 'bacon', 'orange', 'sausage', 'tomato'])
# The code randomly set the 'choice' variable to one from the list
# You need to write code that will classify what food is.
# If food is set to either 'apple' or 'orange', your code should print 'fruit'.
# If food is set to either 'bacon' or 'sausage', your code should print 'meat'
# If food is set to either 'salad' or 'tomato' your code should print 'vegetable'

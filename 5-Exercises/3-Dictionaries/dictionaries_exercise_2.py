## Dictionaries. Exercise #2
# We have a dictionary:
friend = {
    "first_name": "Alex",
    "last_name": "Best",
}
# Declare a variable with name 'full_name' that is equal to
# friend's first and last names with a space between.
# You must reference the values associated with those
# keys in the 'friend' dictionary.
# Expected output: Alex Best

## Lists/ Exercise #2
# We have a list of friends:
friends = ["Kestas","Dovile","Alex", "Milana","Viktorija"]
# Change "Kestas" to "Petras"
# Change "Milana" to "Rasa"
# Change "Viktorija" to "Sandra"
# Hint: You can use the following syntax to change a value
# of an existing list element at the specific index position:
# my_list[0] = "NewValue"
# Here, my_list would represent the variable holding the list
# that we are modifying, and the 0 in square brackets would
# be the index number of the targetted list element that we
# are changing, and we would use the assignment operator = to set
# it to a new value. You can use this approach with the people
# list in this exercise to make the necessary modifications,
# as instructed above!

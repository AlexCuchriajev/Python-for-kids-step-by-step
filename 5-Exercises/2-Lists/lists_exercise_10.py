## Lists. Exercise #10
# Using nested list comprehension and range() create a list "result"
# with the following value :
# [
#  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
#  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
#  ]
# It's a 10 x 10 nested list.  10 rows, each row contains' the numbers 0-9.

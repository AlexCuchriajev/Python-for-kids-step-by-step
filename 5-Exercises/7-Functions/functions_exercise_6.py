## 7-Functions. Exercise #6
# The count_stars function is broken.
# It's supposed to return the number of * characters in a given string.
# Expected output: count_stars("*uper *ize") --> 2 .
# But the function returns either 0 or 1. What can be the reason of this?
# You need to fix it without adding any new lines of code, count_stars work as intended.
# def count_stars(text):
#     count = 0
#     for char in text:
#         if char == '*':
#             count += 1
#         return count

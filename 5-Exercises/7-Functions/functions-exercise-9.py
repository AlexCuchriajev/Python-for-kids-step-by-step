## Functions. Exercise #9
# Write a function with name 'day_of_week'. This function takes in one argument
# (a number from 1-7) and returns the day of the week. If the number is
# less than 1 or greater than 7, the function should return "Wrong number. Try again"
# Hint: You can use a list to store the days of the week (or dictionary).
# Expected output:
'''
day_of_week(1) -> "Monday"
day_of_week(2) -> "Tuesday"
day_of_week(3) -> "Wednesday"
day_of_week(4) -> "Thursday"
day_of_week(5) -> "Friday"
day_of_week(6) -> "Saturday"
day_of_week(7) -> "Sunday"
day_of_week(12) -> "Wrong number. Try again"

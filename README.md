ðŸ‘‡ **_Please read the following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) carefully before starting the course_** ðŸ‘‡

## FAQ

### Q1: How do I download the files?

**A:** If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the entire code, hit the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option. If you can't see the button (on mobile), use [this link](https://github.com/AlexCuchriajev/Python-for-kids-step-by-step/archive/master.zip) instead.

### Q2: I'm stuck! Where do I get help?

**A:** Have you actually tried to fix the problem on your own? Have you compared your code to the final code? If you failed fixing your problem, please **post a detailed description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy**. You will get help there.

### Q3: Videos don't load, can you fix it?

**A:** Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about it. The course is hosted on Udemy, and sometimes they have technical issues like this. Please just come back a bit later or [contact their support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).

### Q4: Videos are blurred / have low quality, can you fix it?

**A:** Please open video settings and change the quality from 'Auto' to another value, for example 720p. If that doesn't help, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).

### Q5: I love your courses and want to get updates on new courses. How?

**A:** First, you can subscribe to my email list [at my website](http://acoptex.eu/resources). Plus, I make important announcements on twitter [@acuchriajev](https://twitter.com/acuchriajev), so you should definitely follow me there ðŸ”¥

### Q6: How do I get my certificate of completion?

**A:** A certificate of completion is provided by Udemy after you complete 100% of the course. After completing the course, just click on the "Your progress" indicator in the top right-hand corner of the course page. If you want to change your name on the certificate, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).

### Q7: Can you add subtitles in my language?

**A:** No. I provide professional English captions, but Udemy is responsible for subtitles in all other languages (automatic translations). So please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us) to request your own language.

### Q8: Do you accept pull requests?

**A:** No, for the simple reason that I want this repository to contain the _exact_ same information that is shown in the videos. However, please feel free to add an issue if you found one.

### Q9: Where is the resources page you keep mentioning?

**A:** It's on my website at <http://acoptex.eu/resources>. You can subscribe for updates ðŸ˜‰

### Q10: I want to put these projects in my portfolio. Is that allowed?

**A:** Absolutely! Just make sure you actually built them yourself by following the course, and that you understand what you did. What is **not allowed** is that you create your own course/videos/articles based on this course's content!
